## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned more about before and after pseudo-elements. That helped me a lot in this project.

### Continued development

I want to practice more CSS Grid projects. I didn't do very much until now, but it's very interesting.
